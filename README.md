## About
This project includes the boilerplate code for GenLayer use cases, including a football bets game and consensus-based milestone evidence review.

## What's included
- An example intelligent contract (Football Bets) with web access and LLM integration
- A milestone evidence review contract that uses web access and validator consensus to assess deliverables against written criteria
- **Direct mode tests** — fast, in-memory unit tests with web/LLM mocking (~ms per test)
- **Integration tests** — full end-to-end tests against GenLayer Studio
- **Contract linting** — static analysis to catch common contract issues before deployment
- **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions workflow for linting and direct tests
- A production-ready Next.js 15 frontend with TypeScript, TanStack Query, and Radix UI
- Configuration file template and deployment scripts

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.12
- [GenLayer CLI](https://github.com/genlayerlabs/genlayer-cli) globally installed: `npm install -g genlayer`
- GenLayer Studio (for integration tests and deployment): Install from [Docs](https://docs.genlayer.com/developers/intelligent-contracts/tooling-setup#using-the-genlayer-studio) or use the hosted [GenLayer Studio](https://studio.genlayer.com/)

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up Python environment

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Lint your contracts

Run the GenVM linter to catch issues before deployment:

```shell
genvm-lint check contracts/football_bets.py
```

The linter catches:
- Forbidden imports and non-deterministic calls
- Invalid storage types (must use `TreeMap`, `DynArray`, `u256`, etc.)
- Missing decorators and return type annotations
- Non-deterministic operations outside equivalence principle blocks
- And [20+ other rules](https://github.com/genlayerlabs/genvm-linter)

### 3. Run direct mode tests

Direct mode tests run contracts in-memory without needing GenLayer Studio. They use mocks for web requests and LLM calls, giving you fast feedback (~milliseconds per test):

```shell
pytest tests/direct/ -v
```

Direct mode features used in these tests:
- `direct_deploy("contracts/file.py")` — deploy contract in memory
- `direct_vm.sender = address` — set transaction sender
- `direct_vm.mock_web(pattern, response)` — mock HTTP/render calls
- `direct_vm.mock_llm(pattern, response)` — mock LLM responses
- `direct_vm.expect_revert("message")` — assert expected failures
- `direct_vm.clear_mocks()` — reset mocks between calls

### 4. Deploy the contract

1. Choose your network: `genlayer network`
2. Deploy: `genlayer deploy` (runs the script in `/deploy/deployScript.ts`)

### 5. Run integration tests

Integration tests deploy the contract to GenLayer Studio and test with real consensus:

```shell
gltest tests/integration/ -v -s
```

These require GenLayer Studio running (local or hosted).

### 6. Set up the frontend

1. Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env`
2. Add your deployed contract address as `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`
3. Run:

```shell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:3000/.

## How the Football Bets Contract Works

1. **Creating Bets**: Users bet on a football match by providing the game date, teams, and predicted winner.
2. **Resolving Bets**: After the match, the contract fetches results from BBC Sport, uses an LLM to extract the score, and validates via the equivalence principle.
3. **Points**: Correct predictions earn points. Users can query their points or the leaderboard.

## Milestone Evidence Review

`contracts/milestone_review.py` demonstrates a milestone workflow where a project owner writes measurable acceptance criteria, another account submits a public HTTPS evidence URL, and anyone can trigger a GenLayer consensus review. The review fetches the page, treats its contents as untrusted evidence, and uses comparative consensus so validators independently assess the criteria and agree on an approve/reject result. The party adversely affected by the decision can submit one additional evidence URL for a single appeal and request a second consensus review.

The contract records criteria, parties, evidence URLs, appeal usage, status, and the final decision. It does not hold or transfer funds: it is an adjudication primitive that an application could integrate with a separately designed escrow. The example stores only a binary decision, not free-form model explanations, so validators compare a compact result.

Typical lifecycle:

1. The owner calls `create_milestone(milestone_id, criteria)`.
2. A different account calls `submit_evidence(milestone_id, evidence_url)`.
3. Any account calls `resolve_milestone(milestone_id)` to request consensus review.
4. If the submitter is rejected, they can appeal; if the submission is approved, the owner can appeal. The affected party can call `appeal_decision(milestone_id, additional_evidence_url)` once; anyone can then resolve the appeal.

Evidence URLs must use HTTPS. Reviewers should write objective criteria and submit pages that are publicly accessible and directly relevant to the deliverable. A consensus decision is an example judgment, not a guarantee that the evidence is authentic or that a real-world payment should be made.

## Testing Strategy

| Test Type | Command | Speed | Requires Studio |
|-----------|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Lint** | `genvm-lint check contracts/*.py` | ~250ms | No |
| **Direct** | `pytest tests/direct/ -v` | ~ms/test | No |
| **Integration** | `gltest tests/integration/ -v -s` | ~min/test | Yes |

**Recommended workflow:**
1. Lint after every contract change
2. Run direct tests frequently during development
3. Run integration tests before deployment to verify consensus behavior

For AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.), the linter and direct tests provide the fast feedback loop needed for iterative development without requiring a running Studio instance.
